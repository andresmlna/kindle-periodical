Kindle Periodical
=================

A kindle periodical utils in python for generating kindle .mobi files in periodical style.
I was not sure if I am allowed to provide kindlegen software so you need to put a kindlegen binary in bin/ folder in order to generate .mobi
All files are generated in temp folder.
I use a set of templates to generated .opf, .ncx, articles and content.html files

You can run a simple test with just:
    
    $ python kindle/periodical.py
